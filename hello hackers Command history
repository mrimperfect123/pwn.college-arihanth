# Command History
The challenge teaches you how to reduce your typing time or copy pasting time just by usingh up arrow and using your previous codes

## My Solve
**Flag:** ' pwn.college{ktM4Dvwi_2mytHLAUY6fwdZ7Yng.0lNzEzNxwyN4EzNzEzW}'

In this challenge we were suppose to use up and down arrow to reduce our typing time and using the old history of commands written by us 

```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ echo Hello
Hello
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ echo Hello         #here we used up arrow in order to copy and paste the same command as above
Hello 
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{ktM4Dvwi_2mytHLAUY6fwdZ7Yng.0lNzEzNxwyN4EzNzEzW}    #here i just pressed up arrow key twiice in order to find that secret code hidden in the challenge 
```

## What I Learned
